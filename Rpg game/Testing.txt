Rpg game testing

tried to test 2nd fight
Realised the sidequest was after the fight so i moved it before
#Also fixed persisting error where lvl(lower case l) and lv1(number one) look the same
14:06 19/06/2024
found an error in sidequest where removing string from list inventory doesn't work because its not an int
changed pop to remove
#nope haven't  - popped up with an error - but in testing to get to the 2nd fight (via sidequest)
managed to get to the start of the fight 

14:03 20/06/2024
fixed the error hopefully
note: l is taller 1 is slanted
14:09 20/06/2024
played through the fight(without sidequest) and won
however afterwards it just went back to the lvl 1 fight
fixed temporarily by adding an exit() though i am not sure what is causing the error

optimization
removing unessary time.sleeps

found a bug in the fight
you can't enter more than your sword can deal ONCE - the second time it lets you
then infinite loop
improved with if else and while so it will loop until you put in the correct value
discovered you can send just variables doesn't have to be integers to functions
good for integers that are random so you don't know how many gold coins/health player will have

added more plot and lvl3
more mechanics
added more detailed instructions
bug: when you accept icecream but not cupcake it loops back to start
this was because instructions were inside atHome
